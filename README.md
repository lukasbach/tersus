15 different widgets help you to create a customized dashboard. Keep track of recurring chores, appointments or tax deadlines, visualize how consistently you accomplish regular habits, manage various custom counters and more.

Tersus does not require any registration, you can just create a new dashboard and start adding widgets. You get a shareable URL for every dashboard, which you can use to share the dashboard with others.

## Templates

You can immediately get started with one of the following dashboard templates. Clone any of the following templates and get started by customizing it.

You can clone each of the templates on the [Tersus App Homepage](https://tersus.lukasbach.com).

### Household Chores Dashboard

Track recurring chores, like laundry, plant watering, or vacuuming. Share a todo list with your roommates or family, and keep an always-visible note available for everyone to edit.

You can easily customize this dashboard to fit your needs, based on who you share your living space with and what chores you need to keep track of.

### Walking Distance Tracker

A sample dashboard for a counter widget that visualizes the distance you walk every day.

I am using a variance of this dashboard to keep track of my daily usage of my indoor walking pad, but you can use this dashboard as base for all kinds of counters.

### Yearly Event Tracker

A set of widgets to keep track of various counts and events throughout the year.

Count the numbers of days you work from home to remember it on your tax return, keep track of the number of workout sessions you did during the year, or remember how many movies you watched.

### Routes Dashboard

The Route Widget allows you to very easily see which route is currently best on regular trips you take, and how long it would currently take you.
